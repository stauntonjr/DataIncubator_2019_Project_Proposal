# DTI_2019_Project_Proposal
This repository contains my project proposal for Section 3 of The Data Incubator 2019 Fellowship Application Challenge. The proposal takes the form of a Jupyter notebook written with Python 3 using numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib and seaborn. The proposed project addresses the relationships between race, health care, and cancer in America. Data on cancer incidence and county population statistics from census.gov, clinicaltrials.gov, and cancer.gov were aggregated as described at https://data.world/nrippner/cancer-trials by data.world user nrippner. This dataset is kindly provided by nrippner and was accessed from https://query.data.world/s/3b96GyLkqZ1IgCONmj193k1yF59fNz.

A cursory exploration of the data reveals some interesting trends. Firstly, Figure 1 shows that among U.S counties, the relative size of the black population is positively correlated to public healthcare coverage and negatively correlated to private healthcare coverage. Secondly, Figure 2 shows that there is a distinct subset of counties with a higher percentage of cancer diagnoses, which have a considerably lower fraction of citizens that are insured only by public healthcare and a slightly higher than average fraction of citizens that are insured only by private healthcare. This suggests that among the counties in which better preventative care is giving rise to a higher number of (hopefully early and thus manageable) diagnoses of cancer, more people are insured with private than public health insurance.

As a follow-up, US Census Bureau data from the American Community Survey (ACS) were examined to find public vs. private health insurance coverage rates over time for black vs. non-black individuals as reported in the ACS 2013-2017 Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS). This data was accessed using DataFerrett, a Java-based tool developed by the Census Bureau. The powerpoint file contains an additional figure showing the percentages of the black and non-black populations with private, public, and any health insurance coverage in the years 2013-2017. The entire dataset accessed had a size of 13.9 GB. The data show that public, private and total coverage slightly increased through 2016, and slithly decreased in 2017. Versus Non-Black populations, Black populations had a greater percentage of public coverage, a lesser percentage of private coverage, and a lesser percentage of total coverage throughout the timespan, but over time the disparity decreased slightly.
